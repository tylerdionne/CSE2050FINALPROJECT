			Drivers with conventional brakes must pump the brakes in order to stop in an emergency situation where traction is lost and the vehicle slides. Note: Do NOT do this if your vehicle has ABS. ABS will do its own brake pumping to keep the wheels from locking, so you can apply the brake pedal firmly until the vehicle stops. If you pump the brakes, you'll just deactivate the ABS.

No-Zones exist to the front, rear, and sides of the vehicle. It is impossible to completely avoid a large vehicle's No-Zones. However, do not remain in a No-Zone any longer than necessary to safely pass the vehicle. And never tailgate a truck.
